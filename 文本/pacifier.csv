She loved it. It is machine washable and as soon as you take it out, it does not really need to be dried as it is dried already and is ready to be used.<br />I thought it was a bigger giraffe and was disappointed at first to see it so tiny, but I believe it is the appropriate size for an infant not to choke on. It is a pricey ($13-$14 ea.). Wish it was half price, and wish I could replace pacifiers on the stuffed animal, but can not, since it is sewed with stitches to the giraffe.<br /><br />BabyHaven is really professional and nice. When I received other regular Soothie pacifiers in damaged boxes, they offered to send me replacements for free. Hoping to receive them soon by mail.<br />----------------------------------------<br />Edited April 8, 2013:<br />I now have an Amazon Prime Membership with my Amazon Mom membership, I receive everything in 2 days and can return items with no hassle. Back when I bought the Wubbanub and Avent Soothie Pacifiers from BabyHaven, I thought they proposed to send me free pacifiers to replace the damaged packages I received but they did not and wanted me to pay for the return shipping rate. They said since product is not damage it is my responsibility. They tucked 6 Avent soothie pacifiers and 3 wubbanub pacifiers in one small bubbly envelop!!! The Avent Soothie's package was ruined but they did not care.<br />They were not so professional what so ever.<br /><br />We are treated better when we get the Prime Membership as we deal with Amazon directly versus with the seller. Packaging is better, as they send in a boxes even small ones versus in an envelop that gets ur package damaged from shipping.<br /><br />Would still recommend the product though.

And I love how many models you can choose from! It is such a good idea to combine a pacifier with a plush toy. So cute, and so convenient to take in the car, or to give baby at night. I agree with people who say that the pacifier doesn't stay long in their kid's mouth: my baby, too, pulls the pacifier out of her mouth because she keeps grasping and playing with the giraffe. But that's ok with me, as long as she is having fun with it.<br /><br />However, I have to complain about the poor quality of this item:<br />- I saw someone writing that the plush looked like a happy meal toy. Yes, it does, indeed! It is soft enough for my baby to enjoy, but I still feel that for the price it could be somewhat nicer.<br />- The pacifier is not the best. The shape is actually pretty bad. The base of it shouldn't be round and have a 'cut-out' for the nose, like most other pacifiers do.<br />- I HATE that the plush doesn't detach, it makes it so much more difficult to wash. I would actually have liked it if you could detach the plush to wash it, and why not re-attach it to any pacifier, so that you could change the color of the pacifier, upgrade for a 6+ month pacifier, replace it when it is damaged, etc. I get that they don't want you to buy another brand of pacifier, but couldn't they at least make a system where you can remove and attach to this brand of pacifiers, and sell separate pacifiers and plush toys? Kind of a 'mix-n-match' concept? That would be sooooo great!<br /><br />Would these points be solved (and they are easily solved), it would be one of the best items on the market for a young baby. I also bought one for my godson and he loves his so much, too, but his mom has the exact same issues than I do. Anyhow, I don't regret my purchase but hope that Wubbanub will make this product better before I have another baby...",3/23/2013

She learned fairly quickly how to put this back in her mouth on her own which saved us many a trip up and down the stairs to her room.  She only uses him at night and on occasion when she's trying to sleep while we are out and about.  The giraffe makes grabbing and replacing so much easier for little ones.  Well worth the money.  Easy to clean too as we just put him in a pillow case and run it through a delicate cycle with her other clothes.,4/25/2014

I received a frog one for my baby shower, and, even though my little boy doesn't rely too much on comfort sucking, he really appreciates having the frog around, so I bought him a little giraffe that could stay in his nursery for when he is soothing himself to sleep.  He almost never uses the pacifier , but loves to chew the side.  He also loves to study the faces and then, naturally, he needs to eat the faces...because that's just what babies do :)  This is a great addition to a baby shower gift, in my opinion!",9/5/2013

The swaddle material is WAY too flexible. It allowed my 10 lb 6 week old baby to maneuver his way out of it.  That should NOT happen with a baby this tiny and with such unintentional, immature movements. So, getting past that...the &#34;weights&#34; (sewn in bean bags like the little ones you toss) are awkwardly placed. I think if they would place Velcro on the inside and some velcro on a couple bean bags...it would work better. When you finally stretch out this material and get baby all wrapped up...you'll find the weights are in weirdo spots. It was a poor investment. On a positive note, I did buy a different wrap the Alden + Anais &#34;Easy Swaddle Blanket&#34;. Perfect Swaddle with a perfect fit.
